h1. Larv: Entity framework for Python

Larv was thought out to be used in games.
It's currently tested in python 3.2.3.
Inspired by and using the style of: http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/

h2. How to install/use

Simply copy/paste the larv folder to your python installation.
For example, say that you have your python installed in:
    C:\Python
Then you would need to paste the folder to:
    C:\Python\Lib
So that in the end the following path exists:
    C:\Python\Lib\larv

Then you are free to test if that worked opening the python idle and doing a fast:
    import larv

h2. Documentation

There is a basic documentation included in the form of html files with the project,
to read it, just open the files with your prefered browser.
