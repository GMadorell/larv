class EntityFactory:
    """
    Entity factory is just a helper, it doesn't have any methods.
    When implementing a game, every entity will be created from here, so it's
    really only a class to put together all the building of entities for easier
    reading and usage of the rest of the code.

    It has a createX for every entity in the game.
    Handles the creation of the entities and also assigning components to them.

    USAGE:
      When creating the entity factory for your own game, just subclass it and add
      a createX for every X entity you want in your game (remember to import
      all the components you are gonna use beforehand).
      The entity factory will be needed when you create a larv.Engine.Engine
      instance, so programmatically you will need to create it before the engine.
